# .NET Core Community Home

.NET Core Community(NCC) is an open source community based on the .NET Core technology stack. It was created by [Alex LEWIS](https://github.com/alexinea), [Haoyang LIU](https://github.com/liuhaoyang), [Zhenxi HE](https://github.com/utilcore), [Yang XIE](https://github.com/kiler398) and Yu LOU in 2016. We hope that through our efforts, we can make the .NET Core ecosystem more exciting.

## The History of NCC

NCC was founded in mid-2016, the original name is ".NET Core China Studying Group". At the same time, we created a QQ Group called "dotNET Core Studying Group".

The original goal of NCC was to translate the documentation of Microsoft ASP.NET Core. We have received a lot of help and encouragement from many people ([List of contributors for 2016 translation project](./docs/history/people-who-translated-in-2016.md)). And [the works of our translation](https://github.com/dotnetcore/aspnetcore-doc-cn) also provided great convenient for the first Chinese developers who learned ASP.NET Core.

After two years of challenge, NCC became an open source community organization with more than one dozen projects and multiple sub-teams.

We have received support from many people, including the sponsorship of JetBrains.

In 2019, we provided the NCC domain asset 'dotnet-china.com' to the [.NET China Community Joint Meeting (NCJM)](https://github.com/dotnet-china), we started a new domain '[dotnetcore.xyz](https://www.dotnetcore.xyz)'. We NCC are working with NCJM, to make .NET GREATER together.

## Repos and Projects

Our project is divided into two phases: the _NCC Sandbox Projects phase_ and the _NCC Top-Level Projects phase_. When a new project is applied to join NCC and successfully pass the review and complete the preparatory work before joining, the project will automatically enter the _NCC Sandbox Projects phase_. If you want to apply to join NCC, please read the [How to join us](#how-to-join-us) section.

### Our Top-Level Projects

Projects in the _NCC Top-Level Projects phase_ can be used in production environments.

- **[AspectCore](https://github.com/dotnetcore/AspectCore-Framework)**, an AOP-based cross platform framework for .NET Standard.
- **[CAP](https://github.com/dotnetcore/CAP)**, a distributed transaction solution in microservice based on eventually consistency, also an eventbus with Outbox pattern.

### Our Sandbox Projects

Projects in the _NCC Sandbox Projects phase_ are still in development and they need more time and practice to test their designs.

- **[Alipay SDK](https://github.com/dotnetcore/Alipay.AopSdk.Core)**, A third-party Alipay server SDK, based on .NET Standard 2.0 development, provides a more reliable design than the official, but remains consistent with the official apis.

- **[EasyCaching](https://github.com/dotnetcore/EasyCaching)**, an open source caching library that contains basic usage and some advanced usages of caching which can help us to handle caching more easier.
- **[Natasha](https://github.com/dotnetcore/Natasha)**, Simplify IL operations, optimize the IL programming flow, and write dynamic caches that provide high performance.
- **[SmartCode](https://github.com/dotnetcore/SmartCode)**, An excellent open source code generator (of cause not only a generates code). It's based on execution flow, supports ETL mode, highly flexible and scalable, also supports custom templates and multiple template styles, and multiple databases.
- **[Util](https://github.com/dotnetcore/Util)**, an open source application framework under the .NET Core platform, designed to improve the development efficiency of small teams.
