# .NET Core Community Home

.NET Core Community(NCC) is an open source community based on the .NET Core technology stack. It was created by [Alex Lewis](https://github.com/alexinea), [Haoyang Liu](https://github.com/liuhaoyang), [Zhenxi He](https://github.com/utilcore), Yang Xie and Yu Lou in 2016. We hope that through our efforts, we can mekw the .NET Core ecosystem more exciting.

## The history of NCC

NCC was founded in mid-2016, the original name is ".NET Core China Study Group". At the same time, we created a QQ Group called "dotNET Core Studing Group".

The original goal of NCC was to translate the documentation of Microsoft ASP.NET Core. We have received a lot of help and encouragement from many people. And the works of our translation alse provided great convenient for the first Chinese developers who learned ASP.NET Core.

After two years of challenge, NCC became an open source community organization with more than one dozen projects and multiple sub-teams.

We have received support from many people, including the sponsorship of JetBrains.

## Repos and Projects

Our project is divided into two phases: the _NCC Sandbox Projects phase_ and the _NCC Top-Level Projects phase_. When a new project is applied to join NCC and successfully pass the review and complete the preparatory work before joining, the project will automatically enter the _NCC Sandbox Projects phase_. If you want to apply to join NCC, please read the [How to join us](#how-to-join-us) section.

### Out Top-Level Projects

Projects in the _NCC Top-Level Projects phase_ can be used in production environments.

- **[AspectCore-Framework](https://github.com/dotnetcore/AspectCore-Framework)**, an AOP-based cross platform framework for .NET Standard.
- **[CAP](https://github.com/dotnetcore/CAP)**, a distributed transaction solution in microservice based on eventually consistency, also an eventbus with Outbox pattern.
- **[DotnetSpider](https://github.com/dotnetcore/DotnetSpider)**, a .NET Standard web crawling library similar to WebMagic and Scrapy. It is a lightweight ,efficient and fast high-level web crawling & scraping framework for .NET.
- **[NPOI](https://github.com/dotnetcore/NPOI)**, a .net library for reading and writing MsOffice binary and OOXML file formats.
- **[Surging](https://github.com/dotnetcore/Surging)**, a distributed micro-service engine that provides high-performance RPC remote service calls.

### Out Sandbox Projects

Projects in the _NCC Sandbox Projects phase_ are still in development and they need more time and practice to test their designs.

- **[Util](https://github.com/dotnetcore/Util)**, an application framework under the .net core platform, designed to improve the development efficiency of small teams. It is composed of common public operation classes (tool classes), hierarchical architecture base classes, Ui components, third-party component packages, and third-party service interface packages. , supporting code generation template, permissions and other components.
- **[EasyCaching](https://github.com/dotnetcore/EasyCaching)**, an open source caching library that contains basic usage and some advanced usages of caching which can help us to handle caching more easier.
- **[WebApiClient](https://github.com/dotnetcore/WebApClient)**, an open source project based on the HttpClient. You only need to define the c# interface and modify the related features to invoke the client library of the remote http interface asynchronously.
- **[WTM](https://github.com/dotnetcore/WTM)**, a development tool for small and medium-sized back-end management systems. Implement zero-code creation project, zero-code generation management module. The framework strictly follows the development model of MVVM and won the essence of MVVM. For novices, you can quickly get started building projects; for the masters, you can hand over the tedious and repetitive work to the framework to generate and concentrate on the difficult needs. The framework is tested by dozens of real projects, which can greatly improve development efficiency and reduce development costs.
- **[Alipay SDK](https://github.com/dotnetcore/Alipay.AopSdk.Core)**, A third-party Alipay server SDK, based on .NET Standard 2.0 development, provides a more reliable design than the official, but remains consistent with the official apis.
- **[Natasha](https://github.com/dotnetcore/Natasha)**, Simplify IL operations, optimize the IL programming flow, and write dynamic caches that provide high performance.
